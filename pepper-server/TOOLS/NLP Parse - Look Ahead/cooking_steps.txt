In a medium size mixing bowl, lightly beat two eggs.
Add ground chuck, bread crumbs, milk, grated cheese, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, red pepper, black pepper and salt. Gently combine until incorporated. Overmixing will pack the meat and create dense meatballs.
In a large skillet, over medium-low, heat olive oil.
Once the oil is hot, toss meatballs in. Turn every two minutes or so (when they turn brown), being careful not to burn them. When the meatballs have been browned, transfer to a plate covered with a paper towel.
As the oil cools, transfer to a large pot by pouring it through a mesh sieve. Depending on how much there is left, you may not want to put it all in.
Toss in onion and garlic. This will be the start of your sauce. Let the onion and garlic cook, then add the Prego. Stir until combined.
Add parsley, basil, sugar, salt and red pepper. Turn heat on to low and let sauce simmer for 2-3 minutes.
Carefully place the meatballs over top. Cover with a lid and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes.
While meatballs are simmering, cook pasta. Drain and divide between bowls or plates.
Scoop a ladle of sauce over each ‘bed’ of pasta, then top with 3-5 meatballs. Garnish with additional parmesan romano cheese. Serve immediately.
