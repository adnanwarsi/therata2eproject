The domestication of fowl (esp. chicken) greatly increased the availabiltiy of eggs to ancient peoples. This is thought by some to have begun in China in 6,000BC. Culinary evidence confirms breads and cakes using eggs were made by Ancient Egyptian and Roman peoples. The reason most often sited was the recognition that eggs worked as binding (thickening) agents. How did that begin? The food historians to not venture into this territory. Possibly it was a discovery based on trial and error. Many foods and cooking methods (leavened bread, roasted meats, yogurt) were \"invented\" this way."

During this time, a man named Kundan Lal Gurjal operated a restaurant in the city, called Moti Mahal. So the story goes, the cooks of Moti Mahal would mix leftover marinade juices with butter and tomato, and then stew the tandoor-cooked chicken in it. ItÕs unlikely that they had even the faintest idea of what they had stumbled upon Ð that is, an internationally-loved delicacy. But it is an irrefutable truth of the world that often the best things in life are discovered quite by accident. KundanÕs restaurant quickly became a famous attraction of Delhi, and it wasnÕt long before butter chicken proliferated throughout the world, to be enjoyed by people from every walk of life.\r"

In 1939, he supported the change of name of the country from Siam to Thailand. At the time, wheat noodles were very popular in Thailand, but Plaek Phibunsongkhram sought to eliminate Chinese influence. His government promoted rice noodles and helped to establish the identity of Thailand. As a result, a new noodle named sen chan was created."

Gujral moved to Delhi, India after the Independence of India and Pakistan and the subsequent partition of the Punjab Province. In India, tandoori cooking was traditionally associated with the Punjab and became popular in the mainstream after the 1947 partition when West Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi."

While similar recipes are mentioned in Ancient Roman textsÑand, letÕs face it, the French have been making their famous croque monsieurs since the early 1900sÑtodayÕs notion of the grilled cheese is commonly traced back to the 1920s, when the Iowa man considered Òthe father of sliced breadÓ invented a bread slicer that made distributing white bread easy and affordable. Shortly before that, processed cheese had been patented by James L. Kraft. This Òfactory cheeseÓÑdisparagingly termed Òrattrap cheeseÓ or Òrat cheeseÓ by the English, who were fiercely proud of their cheddarsÑwas not considered a delicacy. It was, simply, a cheap, nutritious, and scalable product."

Muslim Nawabs (Noblemen) would eat Nihari after their sunrise prayers (Fajr), after which they would take naps until the afternoon Muslim prayers (Zhuhr). It later became a regular breakfast dish for the working class due to its energy-boosting properties."

It originated around the 16th century and traditionally consists of crushed garlic, basil and pine nuts blended with Parmesan cheese and olive oil. The name Pesto originates from the Genoese word pest‰, which means to pound or to crush. This refers to the way in which the authentic sauce is prepared, with a mortar and pestle. However, the translation may be a bit misleading because the preparation does not consist of pounding, rather it is of grounding. The reason the preparation is important is in order to release the full aroma of the basil leaf it must not be crushed."

            "historical facts": "Biryani originated in Persia and might have taken couple of different routes to arrive in India. Biryani is derived from the Farsi word 'Birian'. Based on the name, and cooking style (Dum), one can conclude that the dish originated in Persia and/or Arabia. It could have come from Persia via Afghanistan to North India. It could have also been brought by the Arab traders via Arabian sea to Calicut. We know the history little better during 1800 to 1900. During Mogul empire, Lucknow was known as Awadh, giving rise to Awadhi Biryani."
